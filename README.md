## 3. Imagine you're a business owner in Chicago looking to open a new location. Any kind of business will do. In the form of writing, potentially supplemented by sketches (computer-drawn or hand-drawn) and links, we want to see your response to these questions: 

*        What questions could you potentially explore/answer with this data?
*        Ideally, what other data would you gather or combine to learn even more?
*        How would you want to see data presented, to make it actionable by you or others?
